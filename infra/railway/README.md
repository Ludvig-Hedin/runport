# Runport on Railway

Project `runport` (Amsterdam). Public entry: the `router` service
at https://admin.runport.app (also
https://router-production-146b.up.railway.app): `/v1` is the Appwrite API, everything
else the admin. The admin sleeps when idle; the router waits for it to wake.

- `.railway/railway.ts` describes every service, volume and the file bucket.
- `./apply.sh plan` previews, `./apply.sh apply` applies. Secrets come from the
  Keychain service `runport-prod` and are generated once if missing. Never
  run `railway config apply` directly: the SD_* secrets would be missing.
- `router`, `mail-gateway`, `backup` and `monitor` are built from this repo:
  `railway up router --path-as-root --service router`, `../mail-gateway`
  for the gateway, `ops` for both `backup` and `monitor`.
- Mail: the gateway posts to the `runport-mail` Worker
  (`infra/cloudflare-mail`, deploy with `bunx wrangler deploy`), which sends
  with Cloudflare Email Sending from runport.app (apps.ludvighedin.com still allowed). Transactional mail
  only; newsletters need another path.
- `backup` runs nightly at 01:00 UTC: pg_dump to `backups/` in the bucket,
  kept 14 days. `monitor` runs every 5 minutes and emails
  ludvig@ludvighedin.com when the API, the gateway or the backup is wrong.
  Usage statistics are off, so there is no ClickHouse. Appwrite's
  cleanup (`appwrite-task-maintenance`) runs nightly at 01:30 UTC as a
  cron. There is no scheduler or interval task: they serve functions,
  messaging and Appwrite-managed domains, which Runport does not use.
- Owner login for the admin: Keychain `runport-prod` / `owner-email` and
  `owner-password`.
- Own addresses: `bun mcp/src/custom-domain.ts <domain> <service> <port>
  <folder>` registers the domain on Railway and creates its DNS records with
  the Keychain item `cloudflare-dns-token`. Without the token it stops
  before registering, because certificate attempts before DNS exists lock
  the name out at Let's Encrypt for an hour or more.
- The encryption key (`openssl-key`) makes stored data readable. Losing it
  loses the data. Back it up outside this Mac.

Put an app online: `PLATFORM_KEYCHAIN_SERVICE=runport-prod
PLATFORM_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://admin.runport.app/v1
bun mcp/src/deploy-app.ts <slug>`. Each app gets its own Railway project, so
`apply.sh` never touches apps.
